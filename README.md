About Me Page

This "About me" section contains a navy blue back ground with "About Vick" written in orange and the bio portion in white. The Navbar buttons can be found on the top left in white text. I attempted to place a picture of myself to the left hand side of my bio, but was unable to have the image populate despite entering the correct image codes.

Portfolio Page

Unfortunately, this portion did not come out how I envisioned. Once again, I had issues populating my images on this page. I attempted to have two columns with four rows; the first three rows would have two pictures next to each other and the last one would have one large image at the bottom.

Contact Page

The contact page was fairly simple. Once again, I kept the navy colored background theme consistent on this page along with the navigation buttons along to the top right side.# homework2
